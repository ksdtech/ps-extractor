ps-extractor Rails application
Background processing to create DataDirector import files.

Rails app adapted (actually just copied) from Ryan Bates's RailsCasts example 
at http://railscasts.com/episodes/128-starling-and-workling

Thank you, Ryan, for your succinct example!  Built on Rails 2.1.0 with 
these required gems:

starling 0.9.8 (gem install starling)

And these plugins:

workling 0.2.4 (script/plugin install http://svn.playtype.net/plugins/workling/)

Before starting application server, you must create a starling daemon, and 
a workling client daemon:

starling -d -P tmp/pids/starling.pid -q log/
script/workling_starling_client start

Uses DBI connection to extract data from PowerSchool Premier database.  DBI
connect string (to ODBC data source) is configured in the file 
config/ddexport.yml.  A sample is provided.
